    """Schedule an agent reload in background (non-blocking).

    This is a common pattern used across multiple endpoints to reload
    agent configuration after making changes. The reload happens
    asynchronously without blocking the API response.

    IMPORTANT: This function extracts manager and agent_id from the
    request context before creating the background task, to avoid
    accessing request/workspace objects after their lifecycle ends.

    Args:
        request: FastAPI request object (must have multi_agent_manager)
        agent_id: Agent ID to reload

    Example:
        >>> from coapis.app.utils import schedule_agent_reload
        >>> save_agent_config(workspace.agent_id, agent_config)
        >>> schedule_agent_reload(request, workspace.agent_id)
